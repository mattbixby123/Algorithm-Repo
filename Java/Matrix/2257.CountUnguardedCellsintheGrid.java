// Prompt
// You are given two integers m and n representing a 0-indexed m x n grid. You are also given two 2D integer arrays guards and walls where guards[i] = [rowi, coli] and walls[j] = [rowj, colj] represent the positions of the ith guard and jth wall respectively.
// A guard can see every cell in the four cardinal directions (north, east, south, or west) starting from their position unless obstructed by a wall or another guard. A cell is guarded if there is at least one guard that can see it.
// Return the number of unoccupied cells that are not guarded.

// see images for examples @ link: https://leetcode.com/problems/count-unguarded-cells-in-the-grid/description/?envType=daily-question&envId=2024-11-21
// Example 1:

// Input: m = 4, n = 6, guards = [[0,0],[1,1],[2,3]], walls = [[0,1],[2,2],[1,4]]
// Output: 7
// Explanation: The guarded and unguarded cells are shown in red and green respectively in the above diagram.
// There are a total of 7 unguarded cells, so we return 7.
// Example 2:

// Input: m = 3, n = 3, guards = [[1,1]], walls = [[0,1],[1,0],[2,1],[1,2]]
// Output: 4
// Explanation: The unguarded cells are shown in green in the above diagram.
// There are a total of 4 unguarded cells, so we return 4.

// Constraints:

// 1 <= m, n <= 105
// 2 <= m * n <= 105
// 1 <= guards.length, walls.length <= 5 * 104
// 2 <= guards.length + walls.length <= m * n
// guards[i].length == walls[j].length == 2
// 0 <= rowi, rowj < m
// 0 <= coli, colj < n
// All the positions in guards and walls are unique.

//Solution
